Query vs sub query vs correlated sub query

1) Query - normal execution of query
example
select * from employees

Select max(salary) from employees

2) Sub Queries:

In sub Queries always inner queries will be executed first and will be passed as input to the outer query.


Select max(salary) from employees - 24,000

select max(salary) from employees where salary not in (select max(salary) from employees) - 17,000

select max(salary) from employees where salary not in 
(select max(salary) from employees where salary not in (select max(salary) from employees))
and salary not in
(select max(salary) from employees) - 14,000



Select max(salary) from employees where salary not in
(Select max(salary) from employees)
and salary not in
(select max(salary) from employees where salary not in (select max(salary) from employees))
and salary not in
(select max(salary) from employees where salary not in 
(select max(salary) from employees where salary not in (select max(salary) from employees))
and salary not in
(select max(salary) from employees))


select * from employees where salary =
(Select max(salary) from employees where salary not in
(Select max(salary) from employees)
and salary not in
(select max(salary) from employees where salary not in (select max(salary) from employees))
and salary not in
(select max(salary) from employees where salary not in 
(select max(salary) from employees where salary not in (select max(salary) from employees))
and salary not in
(select max(salary) from employees)))


3) Correlated sub query:

In Correlated sub query outer query will be executed first and will be passed as input to the inner query.

select department_id, avg(salary) from employees group by department_id


select * from employees a where salary > (select avg(salary) from employees b where a.department_id=b.department_id)
